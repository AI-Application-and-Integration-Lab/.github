# üëã Welcome to AI Application and Integration Lab

We are a research lab focused on exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence, multimodal understanding, and human creativity. Our goal is to develop intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and generate across different modalities ‚Äî including text and vision.

üìç Located at National Taiwan University, Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering.
